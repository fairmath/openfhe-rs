# Base types and algorithms

There are a couple of base types used around all the FHE-enabled applications. You can check this section or jump directly into our examples and figure out everything through experience.

Remember: if you have any questions not covered on this page - feel free to ping us on our [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/NfhXwyr9M5).

### Cryptography schemes supported

We currently support three so-called PKE schemes:

* CKKS
* BFV
* BGV

Many of our methods and algorithms contain the suffix referring to the scheme used. This section provides examples.

### Params

The Params policy type stores flags and parameters for the FHE algorithms to use.

There are different ways to generate a Params type instance, but the main way is to create a mutable object by calling `GetParams%scheme_name%` and setting the options after that. For the CKKS scheme, it will be `GetParamsCKKSRNS`.

### CryptoContext

CryptoContext type, as its name stands, stores the metadata of your FHE context. You usually create its instance using one of the following functions:

* By generating the CryptoContext directly - `ffi::GenCryptoContextByParamsCKKSRNS`
* By deserializing a CryptoContext generated somewhere else - `ffi::DeserializeCryptoContextFromFile`
