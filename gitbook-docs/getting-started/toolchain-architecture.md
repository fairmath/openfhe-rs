# Toolchain Architecture

Challenges on [FHERMA](../overview/fherma.md) are being solved using one of three languages:

* Go - using [lattigo](https://github.com/tuneinsight/lattigo)
* Python - using [openfhe-python](https://github.com/openfheorg/openfhe-python)
* Rust - using [openfhe-rs](https://crates.io/crates/openfhe)
* C++ - using [openfhe](https://www.openfhe.org/)

We collect winning solutions and put them into the open-source repository [Polycircuit](https://github.com/fairmath/polycircuit). Check out the relevant [documentation page ](<../README (1).md>)to learn more about the collaborative idea behind it.
