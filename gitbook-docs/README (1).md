# Polycircuit

If you have ever tried developing custom FHE-enabled applications, you are familiar with how complicated and frustrating this process is now. There are some toolchains on the market that allow building applications for particular use-cases, but unfortunately, their main focus does not apply to the web3 area. There are also some "Freemium" devtools that do not charge you... unless you want to build a production application with them T\_T\
We want to build a dev env available for anyone for free with no hidden charges. That's the motivation behind [Polycircuit](https://github.com/fairmath/polycircuit).

[Polycircuit ](https://github.com/fairmath/polycircuit)is an application-layer FHE components library built through competitions from the [FHERMA](overview/fherma.md) community. Once the winner of a challenge is determined, their submitted solution is added to the repository via a PR.

The components within the repository are designed with a consistent interface, making them easily integrable into FHE-enabled applications. However, this interface is subject to change as we consistently strive to better accommodate developers' needs. We're actively refining the interface, working in partnership with other projects to de-facto develop an optimal application layer interface standard.

If you're working on a toolchain for FHE development or are interested in contributing to this initiative, [we'd love to hear from you](https://discord.com/invite/NfhXwyr9M5). Collaboration is at the heart of what we do, and we're always looking for new partners to join us in advancing the field of FHE development.
