# Collaborative FHE-(E)VM

{% hint style="info" %}
We call it FHE-(E)VM since this approach allows the construction of more than FHE-EVM. For some use cases, users need custom FHE-VMs, which can be easily built thanks to the modular approach.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

In close collaboration with other privacy-concerned projects, we are designing a modular FHE-(E)VM, which will eventually become a standard of privacy-preserving L2.

Although the main idea is pretty straightforward, there is a couple of concepts which keep it running. Let's briefly walk through them:

* There is a [challenge track ](https://fherma.io/track/66113d791ee31b6643ef634b)on the FHERMA competition platform, where we build the required components step-by-step. We open for submissions one more challenge approximately every two weeks. Anyone can participate, win the prize, and contribute to the open-source future of private computations.
* &#x20;As we do with all our challenges, we will save all the winning solutions in the [Polycircuit ](https://github.com/fairmath/polycircuit)repository. Read more about Polycircuit [here](<../README (1).md>).
* Some day soon (probably by the end of Q3 2024) we will gather all the components for FHE-(E)VM under an EVM-compatible wrapper.
* The FHE-(E)VM or its components can be used by L2 developers to extend their rollups with custom fancy functionality.&#x20;
