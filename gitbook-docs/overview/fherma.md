# FHERMA competition platform

We admire the FHE community and we love open-source. Thatâ€™s why, with the intention to build the foundation for real-world FHE-enabled applications and protocols, Fair Math, jointly with the [OpenFHE](https://www.openfhe.org) team, recently launched the [FHERMA](https://fherma.io/) platform

[FHERMA](https://fherma.io) is a platform for Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) challenges. The main goal of the project is to develop an open-source library of FHE components. Such a library can significantly simplify application development and accelerate the adoption of FHE. The initial focus will be on components for Machine Learning and Blockchain applications.

A key focus during the development of FHERMA is to establish a reliable environment, bringing together mathematicians with a strong understanding of the FHE theory and allowing them to compete with each other transparently and equitably. The platform is fully automated and provides a clear and comprehensible way for an FHE circuit developer to become a member of the open-sourced community.

Right from the start, we decided to focus on the unsolved cases, seeking an FHE-enabled solution. Thus, the initial challenges on FHERMA were motivated by the ML-related privacy issues and existing Web3 scaling issues. Mitigating these long-existed problems will serve foundation for the modern decentralized project, backing them up with optimized and verified FHE components.
