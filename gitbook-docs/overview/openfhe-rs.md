# OpenFHE-rs

Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) is a powerful cryptographic primitive that enables performing computations over encrypted data without having access to the secret key. [OpenFHE](https://www.openfhe.org/) is an open-source FHE library that includes efficient implementations of all common FHE schemes: BFV, BGV, CKKS, DM and CGGI.

OpenFHE-rs is a joint project by Fair Math and OpenFHE. It brings exciting new opportunities for the Web3 community by adding Rust support for the OpenFHE library. OpenFHE is known for its wide range of FHE schemes, all implemented in C++, and now we're bringing these capabilities to Rust developers.

By offering a Rust wrapper for OpenFHE, we make it easier to use these advanced FHE schemes in Rust projects. Whether you're building secure data processing apps or privacy-focused protocols, OpenFHE-rs helps you do so with the power of OpenFHE's algorithms.

OpenFHE-rs is the most comprehensive FHE Rust library in terms of components, which also makes OpenFHE the library that supports the largest number of languages: Python, C++, and Rust.
